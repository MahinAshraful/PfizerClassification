This is the classification models

Each folder is named for the configurations

eg:

n_estimators=100 (number of trees)
max_depth=10 (tree depth limit)
min_samples_split=2 (default - not explicitly set)
min_samples_leaf=1 (default - not explicitly set)
random_state=42 (random seed)
class_weight='balanced' (class balancing)

this will be in folder "est100_d10_3cv_s2_l1_rs42"
