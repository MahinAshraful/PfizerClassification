## Cross-Validation Choice: Why 10-Fold is Superior to 3-Fold  

We validated our model using **StratifiedGroupKFold** with both **3-fold** and **10-fold cross-validation (CV)**. The results showed a clear performance improvement when increasing the number of folds:  

- **3-Fold CV → 88% accuracy**  
- **10-Fold CV → 91% accuracy**  

This gain is expected and consistent with theory:  

### 1. Training Data per Fold  
- In 3-fold CV, each model only sees ~67% of the data during training.  
- In 10-fold CV, each model sees ~90% of the data.  
- Larger training sets reduce bias and allow models to capture patterns more effectively, leading to higher predictive accuracy.  

### 2. Bias–Variance Trade-off  
- With fewer folds, models have less training data and higher bias.  
- With more folds, models generalize better because they are trained on nearly the entire dataset.  
- This explains why 10-fold CV is often the “sweet spot” in machine learning benchmarks.  

### 3. Empirical Evidence from Literature  (RESEARCH IN TEXT)
The **R cvms package documentation** demonstrates this effect in simulation studies. Their vignette *“Multiple-k: Picking the number of folds for cross-validation”* shows:  

- **k = 3 → RMSE ≈ 0.976**  
- **k = 10 → RMSE ≈ 0.902**  
- Same trend for MAE, with **91% of runs supporting lower error for k = 10 compared to k = 3**.  

As they note:  
> “A higher k (number of folds) means that each model is trained on a larger training set and tested on a smaller test fold. In theory, this should lead to a lower prediction error as the models see more of the available data.”

### 📌 Conclusion  
By moving from **3-fold CV to 10-fold CV**, we reduced error and improved accuracy (88% → 91%), which aligns with established statistical findings. Using more folds yields more robust and reliable estimates of model performance because each training run leverages more of the available data.
